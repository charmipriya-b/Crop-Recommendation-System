##  Project Overview

### Problem Statement  
Farmers often struggle to determine which crop will yield the best results given their local soil and weather conditions.

### Project Title  
**Intelligent Crop Recommendation Website**

---

##  Project Description

### Objective  
The goal of this project is to assist farmers by recommending the most suitable crop for their land based on specific soil and weather parameters.

---

##  Methodology

### Data Collection  
We collected data on various soil parameters (such as pH, moisture, nitrogen, phosphorus, etc.) and weather conditions (temperature, rainfall, humidity, etc.) from a particular village.

### Model Development  
We applied machine learning algorithms to analyze the data and predict the most suitable crop for the given conditions.  
Algorithms considered: Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, etc.  
The best-performing model was selected based on accuracy and other metrics.

### Implementation  
We developed a website where farmers can input their soil and weather parameters.  
The website processes this data through the trained machine learning model and provides a crop recommendation.
